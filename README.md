What it does
===
It inverts the colors of the primarily white-themed webpages you visit, making them more suitable for viewing in low light conditions.

Installing
===
* Grab it from the [Google Chrome Store](). 

Features
===
* Customize the level of inversion.
* Schedule Night Vision to run automatically at the specified time.
* Does not invert images (no more scary photograph negatives).
* A partial mode that allows you to turn off night mode manually for specific tabs even during the automatic time slots.
